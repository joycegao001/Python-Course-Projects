# About this repository

I have completed a Udemy course on Python from July to September 2021, and built a simple Tic Tac Toe using Jupiter Notebook. Python is the first programming language I have learnt, and just like others, I absolutely LOVE its simplicity and readability, especially coming back to look at it after working with C++ for a long time. I am planning to dive deeper into the language once I get to the backend section of the website development course, and possibly further down my web dev journey when I start learning Data Science/Machine Learning.
